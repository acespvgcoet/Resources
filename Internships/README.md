# <b>Internships</b>

Internships are an important part of the career of any student. It paves a way for a successful career and becomes a bridge between a student and an employee.
<br>
An internship allows you to take time to understand your role, tasks and the industry. Internships want you to leave knowing more than you came with, and this is most likely the outcome. Take this opportunity to understand each task you are given and every new tool you use.
