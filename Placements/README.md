# Placements and Interview Experiences

We (Batch of 2021) have been documenting our campus interview experiences and noting down the questions that we were asked during every round.  

We've prepared a comprehensive Google Sheet with over 50 entries across around 15 companies that visited our campus.  
These are included but not limited to Xoriant, Principal Global, Schlumberger, LTI, Uptycs, Persistent, NTT Data, Raja Software Labs, VMware, Dassault Systems, etc.

This sheet is constantly being updated as and when someone goes through an interview.
